## Story - _Math rocks go clickety clackety_

It is been a while that my friends and I have been using the discord bot I programmed to roll dice.
It has evolved over the years and has become a software we still use today.

However I started to need something more powerful and more user-friendly. Therefore, I've decided to build a "renewed version"
of Dice Works. This project aims to build a huge software of dice rolling and character management (for dnd 5e).

At the moment it is a simple dice thrower with modifiers, but in the future I'm going to add all the advanced
rolls that I have already implemented in the discord bot.

The name "Dice Works" is a reference to the word "clockworks", but in a dice context.
